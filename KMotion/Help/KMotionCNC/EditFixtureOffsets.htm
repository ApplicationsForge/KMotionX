<p><b><i><font face="Arial" size="4">Edit Fixture Offsets</font></i></b></p>
<p>
<img border="0" src="KMotionCNCfiles/EditFixturesDialog.png"></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The Edit Fixture Offsets Screen allows editing, clearing, 
and saving the 9 fixture offsets (sometimes referred to as Work Offsets) </font> </p>
<p><font face="Arial">The currently selected Fixture Offset is highlighted with 
&quot;***&quot;.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Besides the active Fixture Offset there is also a Global 
Offset (G92).&nbsp; The commanded Machine Position will be computed as:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Machine Position&nbsp; =&nbsp; GCode 
Program 
Position&nbsp; +&nbsp; Active Fixture Offset&nbsp; +&nbsp; Global Offset</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&quot;Clear ALL&quot; can be used to clear all 9 Fixture offsets to 
zero.&nbsp; Individual &quot;Clear&quot; Buttons will clear single offsets.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Fixture offsets are saved into the GCode Variables file.&nbsp; 
If saved they will be restored the next time KMotionCNC is started.&nbsp;  When &quot;Save Always&quot; is checked, the offsets are always saved to the file and will be present the next time the program is started. The file 
used to save the GCode Variables can be specified in the <a href="ToolSetupScreenFiles.htm">Tool Setup</a>.&nbsp; When Variables are 
saved to disk the file must already exist which determines which variables are to be 
saved.&nbsp; The file is read and all the variables present in the file will be 
replaced with their current values.&nbsp; Variables 5221-5226 contain the XYZABC 
coordinates of the first fixture offset.&nbsp; Skip 20 variables for each successive 
fixture.&nbsp; Global Offsets are saved in Vars 5211-5216.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Note that the Setup File can also set various settings 
including offsets and will override values loaded from the Vars file.&nbsp; If 
you do not wish certain parameters to be forced to specific values on startup, 
make sure to remove them from the <a href="ToolSetupScreenFiles.htm#Setup_File">
Setup file</a>. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">If &quot;Cancel&quot; is selected any changes made will be discarded 
and the dialog will exit 
- however if &quot;Save&quot; was used the values at the time of selecting Save will 
remain in the Disk File.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Select &quot;OK&quot; to apply any changes that were made.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Note that Fixture offsets are in units of Inches or mm.&nbsp; 
It is up to the Operator to be in the proper corresponding units mode when 
selecting/changing Fixture offsets.&nbsp; The System must be in the proper 
corresponding units before selecting a Fixture.&nbsp; After a fixture has been 
selected the Units may then be changed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Fixture Offsets can also be changed from within GCode 
using G10.&nbsp; For example:</font></p>
<p><font face="Courier New" size="2">G20 (inches mode)<br>
F30<br>
G10L2P1X0Y0Z0 (Set G54 offset to 0,0,0 used by default) <br>
G10L2P2X2Y0Z0 (Set G55 offset to 2,0,0)<br>
G10L2P3X0Y2Z0 (Set G55 offset to 0,2,0)<br>
<br>
G54 (Set to coordinate system 1 - already by default)<br>
G0 x0y0z0 (Draw a box) <br>
