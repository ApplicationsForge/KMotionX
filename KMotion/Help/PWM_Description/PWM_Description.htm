<h1><i>KMotion's Power Amplifiers and PWM's</i></h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The basic component of <i><b>KMotion's</b></i> switching power amplifiers is 
the <i>Half Bridge</i> (see below).&nbsp; A half bridge allows one point to be 
connected to either Motor Power (V +) or ground by ether closing switch S1 or S2 
(but never both at the same time).&nbsp; The 4 Axis <i><b>KMotion</b></i> board 
contains a total of <i>sixteen</i> half bridges.</p>

<p>To control a simple 2 point load (such as one of the two coils of a stepper 
motor) two half bridges are connected into what is called a <i>Full Bridge</i> (or 
sometimes referred to as an <i>H Bridge</i>). </p>

<p>By closing specific switches, voltage may be applied either direction to the 
load or the load may be shorted (which applies 0 volts across the load) and may 
allow current to recirculate through the load.&nbsp; See the 3 diagrams below.&nbsp; 
This technique is what allows <b><i>KMotion</i></b> to apply positive voltage, 
negative voltage, or zero voltage to a particular load using only a single 
positive 
supply.&nbsp; Furthermore, in order to provide a <i>variable</i> voltage to a 
load, a method of PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) is utilized which rapidly (@ 
~30KHz) switches between two of the three states.&nbsp; By varying the amount of 
time spent in the various states the average voltage that is applied to the load 
may be controlled.</p>
<p>There are two possible methods of performing PWM. <i><b>KMotion</b></i> refers to the two 
methods as <i>Normal</i> (in some literature this is referred to as locked 
anti-phase) or <i>Recirculating.&nbsp; </i></p>
<p>The <i>Normal</i> method always switches between the first two states shown 
below (positive and negative).&nbsp; If the desired average voltage is <i>
positive</i>, then the positive state will be applied for a <i>longer</i> time 
than the negative state.&nbsp; If the desired average voltage is <i>negative</i>, 
then the positive state will be applied for a <i>shorter</i> time than the 
negative state.&nbsp; For example, if +50% of the supply voltage is desired, 
then 75% of the time positive will be applied, and 25% of the time negative will 
be applied.&nbsp; Note that if the desired average voltage is <i>zero</i>, then 
the positive state will be applied for an equal time as the negative state.&nbsp; 
The advantage of this method is that the controlled voltage is very linear 
through zero.&nbsp; The slight disadvantage of this method is somewhat larger 
current ripple.&nbsp; Current ripple also becomes larger as the load inductance 
decreases.&nbsp; Most motors have relatively large inductances so this method 
works well and provides the best performance.&nbsp; However for loads with 
little or no inductance (such as a light bulb) this method is inappropriate as 
full current will always flow regardless of the +/- duty cycle.</p>
<p>The <i>Recirculating </i>method always switches between the zero state and <i>
either</i> the positive state <i>or</i> the negative state depending on whether 
the desired voltage is either positive or negative.&nbsp; For example, if +50% 
of the supply voltage is desired, then 50% of the time <i>positive</i> will be 
applied, and 50% of the time <i>zero</i> will be applied.&nbsp; Note that if the 
desired average voltage is <i>zero</i>, then the zero state will be applied 100% 
of the time.&nbsp; This might be considered more of a true &quot;off&quot; condition, than 
the above method which switches equally between positive and negative.&nbsp; The 
advantage of this method is that there is less current ripple and will even work 
with non inductive loads (like a light bulb).&nbsp; The disadvantage of this 
method is the slight nonlinearity through zero that occurs when transitioning 
from a very short positive pulse to a very short negative pulse.&nbsp; Every 
real switch has a minimum turn on and turn off period which limits the smallest 
size of a pulse.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i><b>KMotion</b></i> also has a <i><a name="3_Phase_mode">3 Phase mode</a></i> 
where two full bridges (only 1/2 of the second is used) and two PWM timers work 
in a special configuration in order to drive a 3 phase brushless motor.&nbsp; 
See the circuit configuration below.&nbsp; Here the supply voltage may be 
effectively applied at any phase angle (direction toward any of the 3 loads).&nbsp; 
The method utilized is analogous to the <i>Normal</i> mode described above and 
has smooth transitions through reversals.</p>
